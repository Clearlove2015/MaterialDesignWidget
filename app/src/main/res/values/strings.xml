Material is the metaphor
Material Design is inspired by the physical world and its textures, including how they reflect light and cast shadows. Material surfaces reimagine the mediums of paper and ink.


Bold, graphic, intentional
Material Design is guided by print design methods — typography, grids, space, scale, color, and imagery — to create hierarchy, meaning, and focus that immerse viewers in the experience.


Motion provides meaning
Motion focuses attention and maintains continuity, through subtle feedback and coherent transitions. As elements appear on screen, they transform and reorganize the environment, with interactions generating new transformations.


Flexible foundation
The Material Design system is designed to enable brand expression. It’s integrated with a custom code base that allows the seamless implementation of components, plug-ins, and design elements.


Cross-platform
Material Design maintains the same UI across platforms, using shared components across Android, iOS, Flutter, and the web.
